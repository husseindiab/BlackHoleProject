# BlackHoleProject
Program to artificially insert a black hole of any radius into any image. Simply specify image path and radius/distance of black hole and code will generate a new image with black hole present. Images are too large to upload to github but can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZRGlPCSwjqIycVQhBxnuZuK5PNpAqMCu?usp=sharing
